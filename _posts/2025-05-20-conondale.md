When I was 16, we walked a section of the Conondale Great Walk for our grade 12 leadership camp. From memory, we covered about 45km over 3 days, and I had blisters by lunch on the first day.

I don't know what possessed me to attempt this walk again, 7 years later. Maybe the blisters had finally healed. Maybe I thought it would be different this time. (Narrator: it was not different.)

56km of pure hillage over 4 days. There were some genuinely awesome views, but also leeches, too little food, and - you guessed it - blisters on the first day. The tracks were overgrown, with plenty of pig damage to keep things interesting.

Not to say I didn't enjoy this walk, but it certainly wasn't my favourite. That said, I can wholeheartedly recommend a southwest tofu pie and a bee sting donut from the Kenilworth Bakery on the way home, which almost made the whole thing worth it.

Almost.
