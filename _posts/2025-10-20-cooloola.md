I don't think it gets much better than this.

Cooloola was my first solo multiday hike, and it was one of the best things I've ever done. 

Ollie dropped me at the northern entrance in Rainbow Beach, which meant I had slightly more downhill than uphill on my walk back to the Noosa North Shore ferry where I'd left my car. I did find him in a tree around the 8km mark, not entirely assured that I wasn't going to die alone in the bush. He walked me to the Lake Poona picnic area, ate half my lunch, and disappeared.

Love of my life.

The next four days were physically brutal but mentally fantastic. Skipping the second campsite to do 35km on the second day was potentially not my brightest idea. I earned some very impressive blisters (the keen reader will pick up that I blister instantly and have not found a solution yet), and I really enjoyed being alone, but I think it'll be a while before I go solo again. Pretty sure I went a little crazy out there on my own.

Easily worth the sore dogs though.
