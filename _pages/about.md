Lab rat, bog enthusiast, general source of distraction.

Most of my time is spent figuring out what genetic data can tell us about ecosystems. I'm into solving questions about invertebrate community ecology and physiology with molecular data.

Outside the lab, I'll be teaching or drawing something or chasing wildflowers or falling down some new rabbit hole entirely. If you're into any combination of science/sustainability/art/chaos, you're in the right place :)
